Task 3.1


According to a task I have to simulate the local network of the organization, which contains 1 house with four floors. The horizontal subsystem of the floor consists of two working groups of 3 and 5 computers, respectively.
Structure the network into 8 subnets and deny traffic between the first and third floors.


First of all, I have to create all the system and configure it.

Set IP adresses to each PC, configure router, set IP for each port, according to gateway

As a result I have recieved working system.
