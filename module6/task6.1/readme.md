### Let's begin our journey to the bash scripting world
## Task 6.1

### Task 1-3. I have created 2 files, added long listing into them and then compared these two files using 2 different methods

### In task #4, I have tried to use vi editor and then nano. I prefer using nano editor for non-complicated and fast tasks. In the future, it is better to use vi or vim

### In the next task I have to create a list, which consistently adds listing from current and non-current directory to the same file

### Task #8 has become first bash challenge, cause I have to create one variable, which contains name and surname, and create complicated command, which should show some text and count number of symbols in name and surname separately
