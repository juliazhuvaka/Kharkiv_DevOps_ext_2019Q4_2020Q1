First of all, I have cloned my repo from GitHub to my Git on laptop using "git clone /url/" 
After successful cloning, I have changed directory to task 1.2 folder where I have created readme.txt. It was necessary to make init commit and allow new branches creation
Than I have created develop branch, checkout on it and created empty index.html file 
After that, created images branch. Added images folder with some images inside it 
Added images source inside it and went back to develop branch. 
Created branch with name “styles”. Checkout on it. Added styles folder with styles source inside it. Changed my index.html, added styles for text inside it 
Than I have went back to develop branch to start branch merging 
Images merging was OK, but when I tried to merge styles branch into develop, merge conflict has appeared.
Conflict was in index.html file cause I have add information into it from different branches. To solve this conflict I have opened index.html via nano and fixed conflict places
After that I have made one more commit to save changes and finally resolved this conflict
Than I have merged develop branch into master and pushed all into GitHub
At the conclusion I have execute "git reflog >~/Desktop/task1.2_GIT.txt" command and pushed this file on GitHub into task1.2 folder

Also I want to add, that it was my first experience with Git and GitHub. And This two days were really incredible. 
So many new knowledges: Git, GitHub, merge conflict solution, experience with html and css.
Feeling of disappointment when something going wrong and feeling happy and relief when I finally managed it!
