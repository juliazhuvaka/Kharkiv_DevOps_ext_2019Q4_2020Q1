## Task 8.1

### First of all, let's describe the database schema. I have decided to create a database for a candy shop. It contains 3 tables: information about customers, their invoices and information about the product

### Then I have installed MySQL on the virtual machine, using ec2 and have connected to it

### Next step is to create our tables, add their primary keys and foreign keys to create a connection between tables

### Then I have added some information to each table

### I have already tried to execute some of the SQL queries DDL, DML, DCL, during main database creation, but let's create a test table and try some new commands

### Next step is to create new user, grant him some rights and try to execute allowed and non-allowed commands

### And let's make some selections from the main table
